# Sleepy Head Modal
My Sleepy Head Modal project is a simple jQuery script that activates a website modal popup when a user is inactive for X amount of time.  Includes free vectors that you can use and abuse on all projects (inc commercial projects).

To see this jQuery JavaScript in action simple [view my JSFiddle DEMO](https://jsfiddle.net/bybe/m8dd2u7z/light/). You can view the [Sleepy Head Modal documentation information](https://www.bybe.net/sleepy-head-modal/) on my blog or alternatively you can [tweet me](https://twitter.com/simonhayteruk) on Twitter!
